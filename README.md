This repository contains my analysis of the 2015 and 2016 Enterprise Surveys for Malaysia and Zimbabwe, respectively. These surveys were conducted by the World Bank. I obtained the data set directly from Enterprise Surveys (http://www.enterprisesurveys.org), The World Bank, for research purposes.

The Enterprise Surveys use standard survey instruments to collect firm-level data on the business environment from business owners and top managers. The surveys cover a broad range of topics including access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, crime, competition, labor, obstacles to growth, and performance measures.
